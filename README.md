Devices P1,P2,P3 and "final device" have a folder each including the .scad files for the device and the channel within the device and an .stl file showing the 3D model.

DetectionSoftware includes the scripts for the motion detection script as a .py, the Hough circle detection as a google colab link and the HOG algorithms as folders containing multiple crucial files.

The Hardware folder contains the Arduino script that handles the motor and the .py script that was used to record videos with the Raspberry Pi setup.
