# The Script to access the Syringe Pump

This script is writen specifically for the pin-board of this syringe pump. 
This script determines what every pin does. This script therefore determines the speed increase per activation of the speed
increase pin. This increase is currently set to one step per activation. The fast motor option is also set with this script.
While this script can be used for any arduino board controlled, stepper motor powered syringe pump, the pin numbers might be
different according to the pin settings.
