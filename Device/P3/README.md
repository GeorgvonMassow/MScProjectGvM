# The Prototype P3

Flow_device_Multi.scad includes the design of the device. The design requires the Flow_channel_test.scad file in order 
to generate the channels in the device. The Flow_device_Multi.scad includes 4 variations of the same prototype. The 4 different
designs have different imaging chamber widths. The first 2 have a width of 2 mm, the third 1 mm and the forth a width of 3 mm.


The Flow_device_Multi.stl file is the 3D model of the decice.
